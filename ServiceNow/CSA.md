In many IT environments, Knowledge Management systems or platforms, like Knowledge in ServiceNow, are used to store and organize internal documentation, scripts, and FAQs for easy access by IT employees. ServiceNow Wiki (option B) is also a plausible choice, as it is often used for documentation within the ServiceNow platform. However, without specific details about your organization's setup, "Knowledge" is a general term for this type of documentation repository.

The correct answers are C, D and F
FYI -- Answer E is wrong. I don't think there is something called a Testing Update set, and if there is, there is no need to use it when testing a catalog item.

---

**👤 PLiza2** ⬆️ 8

A is for sure one of the correct answers. Can't test the flow without Activating it. Just follow the steps in the lab 4.3 of SN Administration Fundamentals course e-book. 
Also C, is correct based on the steps in the LAB. D makes sense since there is Manager approval involved. B - there is no such thing as Instance Incognito Mode, E - there is no Testing Update Set

**👤 naab143** ⬆️ 7

The best practices to follow when testing a catalog item with a manager approval flow are:

A. Make sure the latest flows are activated.

Ensuring that the latest approval flows are activated helps ensure that any recent changes or updates to the approval process are reflected in the testing.
C. Impersonate the requester to ensure the form works.

Impersonating the requester allows you to test the catalog item from the perspective of the end-user, ensuring that the form functions correctly and provides a seamless user experience.
D. Make sure the requester's user record has a manager specified.

Ensuring that the requester's user record has a manager specified is essential for triggering the manager approval flow correctly. Without a specified manager, the approval process may not function as intended.
These practices ensure that the catalog item and its associated approval flow are thoroughly tested and function correctly in a real-world scenario.

**👤 2pagesServiceNowSolutions** ⬆️ 3

When testing a catalog item, having a manager approval flows, which of these ***best practices*** would you follow? (Choose three.)

A (Probably) assuming you are testing that version...the latest version is actually in dev...mid dev maybe???
B (nonsense answer, just ignore this)
C (YES) you have to test as the user, admin and dev may have access to tables that ACLs mean reference fields don't work for a user who does not have access.
D (YES) if you're dot walking from who the requester is/or for you need the manager field populated otherwise teh approval you are testing won't work!
E (Maybe) you test the update set on transfer to other environments, we're not sure if we're testing in early development...in the DEV environment, that being the case A is valid too?
F (NO! )the clue here is "Best practices" and for the same reason as C admin to approve is a good and quick idea...but is it testing the approver? hoes the manager have approver licence? 

Therefore the correct 3 best answers are A,C,D

---

**👤 38d386e** ⬆️ 4

ACD. F is wrong because there isn't an "Admin account" role.

**👤 6d50eb7** ⬆️ 4

**Selected Answer:** E
UI Actions:
Purpose: UI Actions are used to define custom buttons, links, or context menu items that perform a specific action when clicked.
Scope: They can be applied to forms, lists, and other UI elements.
Triggers: UI Actions are triggered by user interaction, such as clicking a button or selecting a context menu item.
Use Cases: UI Actions are often used to trigger server-side scripts, client-side scripts, or other operations when a user needs to perform a specific action, like opening a new record, updating fields, or running a script.


UI Policies:
Purpose: UI Policies are used to dynamically change the visibility and behavior of form elements based on predefined conditions.
Scope: They are applied at the form level and are used to control the visibility, mandatory status, and read-only state of form fields.
Triggers: UI Policies are evaluated when a form is loaded, and their conditions determine whether certain fields should be shown, hidden, made mandatory, or set to read-only.
Use Cases: UI Policies are commonly used to simplify and streamline the user interface by showing or hiding fields based on the values of other fields, making forms more context-aware and user-friendly.

A is correct ( "Batch update sets enable you to group update sets together so you can preview and commit them in bulk.")
another think confirming 'A' is correct ("o
Batch update sets enable you to group update sets together so you can preview and commit them in bulk.

Dealing with multiple update sets can lead to problems, including committing update sets in the wrong order or inadvertently leaving out one or more sets. You can avoid these problems by grouping completed update sets into a batch.

The system organizes update set batches into a hierarchy. One update set can act as the parent for multiple child update sets. A given set can be both a child and parent, enabling multiple-level hierarchies. One update set at the top level of the hierarchy acts as the base update set.

When you preview or commit the base update set, you preview or commit the entire batch. The system determines the processing order, and checks for collisions, based on the dates the changes were recorded, and on their sequential ancestry. Their ancestries are the specific instances in which the changes in the update sets took place.")

**Selected Answer:** C
WHAT IS AN ACCESS CONTROL (ACL)?
An instance uses access control list (ACL) rules, also called access control rules, to control what data users can access and how they can access it. ACL rules require users to pass a set of requirements in order to gain access to particular data. Each ACL rule specifies:
The object and operation being secured
The permissions required to access the object

The method that best fulfills the requirement of making a new service catalog item visible only to managers inside the HR Department is:

B. Add the Department Manager group to the catalog item's user criteria.

By adding the Department Manager group to the catalog item's user criteria, you restrict visibility to only users who are part of that group. This ensures that only managers within the HR Department can see and access the catalog item, fulfilling the requirement accurately.

## Question 18

### Two departments (HR Onboarding and Facilities) have come to you, asking for a way for employees to request event room set up services. The requirements are the same for the form and the task routing to the Facilities' assignment group.
✑ For HR, the item will be used primarily for the Onboarding coordinators, for employee orientation sessions.
✑ For Facilities, the item will be used for anyone in the company who needs room set up services.
However, both departments have their own service catalogs. What do you do, to support these requirements?

### Answer Choices:
**A.** Create one Catalog Item for HR Event Room Set Up and one for Facilities Event Room Set Up; then publish each to the appropriate Catalog.

**B.** Create one Catalog Item for Event Room Set Up; then publish to both Catalogs.

**C.** Create one Catalog Item for Event Room Set Up; then publish to the Parent Catalog, which is accessible to both HR and Facilities.

**D.** Create one Catalog Item for Event Room Set Up; then use ACLs to control access.

The reference link is definitely off. However, when thoroughly researching this I believe the answer would be F. There is a filed classified as "Lookup" that only looks up data from "one" table. The question is confusing because it's not specifying the scenario. I'd put my bets on F since these questions are very particular.

**👤 Cplatt** ⬆️ 4

In a real world scenario where the individual has never built reports before B. Reports>Getting Started would be the best course of action because the individual would need to learn how to build reports. These questions aren't really clear with the scenario based ones such as this one. Coming from real world experiences I always suggest that a person learn about reporting before trying to feel their way through understanding how to build a report. My guess would be E is the expected answer even though it's not practical if someone has never built a report before. I wish ServiceNow would eliminate questions like this.

**Selected Answer:** A
In the default Knowledge Base form, only Can Read and Can Contribute tabs are visible by default. However, 
"Cannot Read and Cannot Contribute can be added by configuring related lists on a form." 
(by ServiceNow Administration Fundamentals (Xanadu))

This means Cannot Contribute is a valid feature, but it isn’t shown unless an admin explicitly adds it to the form layout.
So in practice, if you’re just using out-of-the-box (OOTB) ServiceNow without customizing the form - you’d use the "Can Contribute" tab and exclude users by not adding them there.

A. List Editor

E. Update Selected Action

Both the List Editor and Update Selected Action functionalities in ServiceNow enable users to update multiple records simultaneously. The List Editor provides a spreadsheet-like interface where you can modify multiple records at once, while the Update Selected Action allows you to perform bulk updates on selected records from a list or a report.

From the ebook, chapter 5.1: Knowledge mangers can define knowledge categories to pre-populate the list of available categories, and knowledge contributors can select categories, and add or edit categories, if enabled, for a Knowledge base.

B for sure, D is questionable but the only other answer which would fit

---

**👤 Dewoodma** ⬆️ 1

Options B and D are the only valid roles listed, however, only Knowledge Managers may modify knowledge base categories. KCS Contributors may create and validate knowledge articles in their area as assigned only. See all versions of SNow document on Knowledge Management Roles: https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/reference/r_KnowledgeRoles.html

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 3

I think this question is incorrect. There's really only one correct answer and it's D. In the SN Administration Fundamentals - Vancouver, page 224 there's a Knowledge Management RACI Chart at the bottom of the page. In there the Action called Modify Knowledge Base: Categories, article validity, icon, workflow, etc - This action can be performed only by the admin, knowledge_admin and knowledge_manager. 
Knowledge Author, Knowledge Controller, Knowledge Category Manager, Knowledge Submitters, Knowledge Owners and Knowledge Taxonomy Owner, are not SN knowledge roles at all, based on the RACI. They're not mentioned there. 
Knowledge Contributor - as per the RACI - can create, update, modify, and view knowledge ARTICLES, but has NO permissions to modify Knowledge Categories as the question here asks. Hence really only Admin, Knowledge Admin and Knowledge Manager can modify a knowledge Category, and of the 3 only Knowledge Manager exists in the answer choices.

As a knowledge manager, you can assign other managers, define category structures, configure which users can read and contribute articles, move and pin articles, and modify most fields on the Knowledge Base form. You can also approve the publishing or retiring of knowledge articles in those knowledge bases.

First, ServiceNow checks for TAC rules associated with the parent table name.
Then, it checks for TAC rules associated with the table name itself.
Finally, if no specific rules are found for the parent table or table name, any TAC rules associated with a wildcard (any table name) are applied.

Data policies enable you to enforce data consistency by setting mandatory and read-only states for fields.

Data policies are similar to UI policies, but UI policies only apply to data entered on a form through the standard browser. Data policies can apply rules to all data entered into the system, including data brought in through import sets or web services and data entered through the mobile UI.

---

**👤 Certs_Hub** ⬆️ 1

C "Import Data" is correct answer as per chatgpt. Below explanation.

In ServiceNow, the module used as the first step for importing data is:

B. Transform Data

Explanation:

Transform Data (Option B): The transformation process is often the initial step when importing data into ServiceNow. During this step, data is mapped and transformed to match the structure of the target tables in the ServiceNow instance.
The other options do play roles in the data import process:

Coalesce Data (Option A): Coalescing is often done during the transformation process to combine or merge data from different sources.

Import Data (Option C): After transformation, the import process is executed to load the data into the target tables.

Load Data (Option D): While not a specific module or step, the loading of data is part of the overall import process and typically follows the transformation and mapping steps.

Correct would be "Configure Choices" or "Show Choice List", as Configure Choices isn't an option only E can be correct

---

**👤 NikaDMars** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** E
When a customer wants to change the labels of a choice field (like Priority) — for example, from "1 - Critical" to "P1" — you need to access the list of possible values (choices) defined for that field.

You do this by:
1) Opening a record with the field.
2) Right-clicking on the field label (e.g., "Priority").
3) Selecting “Show Choice List” — this displays the defined choices (value/label pairs).
4) Editing the labels or adding new ones.

You can import data from a local source (e.g. , XML, CSV, Excel ) or from a network server by providing a path and authentication information.

Taken from the training:

An Import Set is used to import data from various data sources and then map that data into ServiceNow tables.

You can import data from:
• A local source file (i.e. XML, CSV, Excel)
• A network server by providing a path and authentication information
• An LDAP connection
• A JDBC connection

Maybe an issue with the way the answer is written for this one as Data Stream Integration Hub is a Utah feature and would be correct however it is written as DataHub (which doesn't exist). Network server should probably reference REST API as that is where the data actually get's imported from after the API retrieves it from the server but is technically correct despite not mentioning REST.

A. Local Sources (i.e. XML, CSV, Excel): ServiceNow allows data to be imported from files in various formats, including XML, CSV, and Excel files. These files can be stored locally on the user's computer or on a network drive.

D. JDBC Connection: ServiceNow also supports the import of data from databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connections. This enables data to be imported from a wide range of database types, such as Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server.

F. LDAP Connection: ServiceNow can also import data from LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directories, which are commonly used to store user and organizational data. This allows user and group data to be imported into ServiceNow from an LDAP directory.

C. DataHub: ServiceNow's DataHub allows data to be imported from external sources, such as cloud-based applications, third-party databases, and other enterprise systems. This enables ServiceNow to act as a central hub for data integration across an organization.

**👤 NikaDMars** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
In ServiceNow, when a user clicks "Create New" on a module, the platform tries to open a form for creating a new record in the associated table. If the user does not have the write role (permission) for that table, the form cannot be rendered, resulting in a blank page.

In this scenario:
* The user can see the application and module (they have read access).
* But they can't create a new record, because they lack write permissions on the Inventory table.

low designers use action result data pills to provide input for other flows, actions, or subflows. Flow designers can use the sequence value in the data pill name to ensure that they select the correct data pill as an input value. When a flow runs an action, it generates the data pill runtime value, which remains the same for the duration of the flow. For example, if a data pill for [Trigger->Incident record] gets populated with incident record values at the start of a flow, the data pill preserves these values for the rest of the flow.

In general, Service Catalog variables do not directly affect the order price. Service Catalog variables are primarily used for collecting user input and customizing the behavior of catalog items or processes. The order price is typically determined by factors such as the pricing rules, configuration items, or pricing models associated with the catalog items or services being ordered.

Q277 is a duplicate of Q190 but they have different answers. Q190 answer is Banner and Q277 answer is User Menu. Neither gives these options in the other question. Both answers are right, however. Open the User menu by clicking your user avatar in the ServiceNow banner. Select the Impersonate user menu item. In the Select a user to impersonate dialog, enter the name of the user to impersonate in the Search for a user field. Select the user from the list and click the Impersonate user button.

There is the same question on examtopics with a picture where you can see the filter, but there is one more answer which is not displayed in this questions. The same question you could find here (question 87): 

https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/servicenow/view/77737-exam-csa-topic-1-question-87-discussion/

There the most voted answer with 60% is "The Service Desk > My Groups Work list shows active work tasks that are not yet assigned." And this answer is not displayed here. So I would vote for D in this question.

---

**👤 Raxon** ⬆️ 2

"My Groups Work" is not accessible without ITIL as it is under Service Desk > My Groups Work. Even before the rewrite. The answer has always been Network & Hardware group.

---

**👤 ba14741** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
It's D

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
The automatic filter for the Service -> Desk My Groups Work module is set to show Active tasks, that are not assigned to anyone and are for the groups you’re a member of. Since we know there are active incidents for the Network and Hardware groups, and there’s no option in the answers to indicate all tasks are assigned to people, then the only option left is that the manager is not a member of the Network and Hardware groups (answer D) 
Answer B is NOT correct because access to Apps and Modules is controlled by roles, and you have to have either the itil role or the sn_change_task role to access the Service Desk Module. Assuming the manager does not have the itil role, means has at least sn_change_task role to get to My groups work. In this case will see any Change related tasks for the 2 groups. (incidents will be hidden from him, but change records and tasks at least should be visible).

Option B should not be chosen in any case, because a 'Record Producer' is defined as following:

'A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that allows end users to create task-based records, such as incident records, from the service catalog. The look and feel of a record producer is similar to that of a catalog item. But the record producer generates a task record such as incident, instead of a requested item.'

So I would vote for ADE

---

**👤 agm43** ⬆️ 2

There are only 4 sections and they are DATA, TYPE, CONFIGURE, and STYLE. And Group by do not include calculations Aggregation does. Both Group by and Aggregation are both under the Configure section therefore making C. Configure the answer.

---

The answer is the Configure section. The data section does not provide any of what the question is asking. Group by is not a section its a subsection under Configure.

*email - returns records with short description that contains word email

---

**👤 gedgy** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
A, C, and D are all correct. It just depends on whether you are looking for email as a standalone word or combined with another word. But all (A, C, D) are correct. The question indicates it wants you to pull any records where the word email is contained. In that case (again technically) D is the most correct.

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** C
It's C. With the short description you can't do "show matching" as in the previous question, you need to search for records that have the word "e-mail" in the short description. and this is done by searching "*e-mail" (wildcard e-mail) in the Short Description column.

**👤 699ed72** ⬆️ 4

1. Load data: Navigate to System Import Sets -> Load

---

**👤 047a2d5** ⬆️ 1

I am with E option, this is the write one, the first step in the process of importing data is Define data source, if you go to Navigation bar and type import data set, you see the module is data source this define where the data come " fetch the data from excel to this staging source.

---

**👤 JinDG** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** E
The Anwser is Not C because you can also create import Set instead of Select one so there is no way either of those two anwsers were correct.
It is also not D since another question(Q.322) with the excat question text doesn't have the option'Load Data', and I am pretty sure you dont load data from the beginning the data is loaded after you hit submit. So the only anwser seems right would be E "Define Data Source"

---

**👤 gedgy** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** D
Gonna have to opt for Load Data. If I already have a spreadsheet where the data is defined, what do I do next? I type Load Data in the app navigator. What next? I create an import set. What next? I choose the source of my data. Clearly the answer is D. If I wanted to start before I knew what the data was then I would select E. However, since the question states that I already have that in the form of a spreadsheet then the answer is D.

---

**👤 Raxon** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
Answer is D. 

"Import Sets" Is under 
"System Import Sets > Advanced > Import Sets" 
Which if you create a new instance is "Empty" & has no way to Load Data. Import Sets only shows you the imported data sources.

Under All menu - The "Integration - Imports" drop down is called "System Import Sets" Load Data is the Module that begins an import to ServiceNow. 

After filling out the form & clicking submit it states "Next Steps...." & provides the following links. 

Import Sets - Go to the import Sets for this data load.
Loaded Data.
Create Transformation Map. 
Import Logs.

---

**👤 1595** ⬆️ 2

Right Ans IS option E

---

**👤 BrooksieOwl** ⬆️ 2

Bit naughty this one and I'd imagine these options wouldnt be the same. If you browse, you have to select "Select Import Set" before you select "Load Data" but you could also type Load Data and you could select that without selecting "Select Import Set"

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** C
I would go with C here. The Module you use to load data is indeed called "Load Data" module, but once you open it, the first thing it asks you to do is select (or create a new ) Import Set table, then you need to choose a data source, and only after you do these 2 things you can click "Submit" which Loads the data....

**👤 FOJ** ⬆️ 5

**Selected Answer:** B
Answer is B. 
Field Matching is the step that defines where the incoming data columns will be written in the receiving table when importing data from a spreadsheet. During the field matching step, you map the columns in the source file to the fields in the target table. This allows you to specify which columns in the source file correspond to which fields in the target table, ensuring that the data is imported correctly.

---

**👤 Nexfo** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** D
Filed Mapping is what you do in Create Transform Map

The B answer says Filed Matching not Filed Mapping...

---

**👤 sri_ravi** ⬆️ 1

B is correct

---

**👤 connal308876** ⬆️ 3

D is correct. Field match was never considered a step. However Create Transform Map, is considered a step in the process.

---

**👤 a00e073** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** D
Questions is on which "step", so i would go with: D.Create Transform Map. At transform map you can then do field matching but the "step" is D.

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 2

Can I say NONE of the above? In reality you can create a transform map record by just specifying the source and target tables and clicking submit. You need to do the firld mapping before you transform. But it's Field MAPPING not Field Matching and it's done in the Transform Map (so it has to be there) through Auto Field Map Matching or Mapping Assist links. Very confusing question...

---

**👤 GoldBear** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** D
D - Create Transform Map is the correct answer. 
B - Field Matching: For Event Management, when creating Event Rule to bind non-host CI using CI field matching, if there are multiple CI records having same name.

**👤 hc1222** ⬆️ 1

---

**👤 Mahe12** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** D
Answer should be Field Mapping. But we dont have that option. 
So its D because Transform Map is a set of field maps.

**👤 KevFun** ⬆️ 1

Wouldn't it be B if it was spelled correctly to Field Mapping? Note that not only the questions could be spelled incorrectly, I recognize that many answers are spelled incorrectly with or without purpose.

Answer is A.
Global [Advanced view] Option for specifying whether the UI policy applies to all form views. If this check box is cleared, the UI policy is view-specific.
By default, the Global UI policy applies to all form views. However, a UI policy can be specific to a view. For example, you can define a UI policy for only the itil view of a form. Use the View field to accomplish this.

The configurations are stored in a configuration management database (ServiceNow CMDB) which consists of entities, called Configuration Items (CI), that are part of your environment. A CI may be:

A physical entity, such as a computer or router
A logical entity, such as an instance of a database

There is an update, as stated in answer "C" but "C" also contains "Rate" which is also incorrect. 

Trick question!

Create, Read, Write, Delete
To make it easier to remember they acronym CRUD was introduced, where U stands for Update.

But such choice is not available in AC rules, you have WRITE only.

The question is confusing, it seems like the correct answer would be "cannot contribute" which is not an option. If you *only* select "can read" then inherently those users can only read and not contribute. So technically this may be the correct answer 
https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/quebec-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/task/t_SelectUserCriteria.html

---

**👤 wnstn75** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
I think it's A. I did 2 tests. 
Knowledge > Administration > Knowledge Bases.=> open a record. 
1.Trying to add a role to both 'can read' and 'can contribute'. It worked. 
 So I think just setting 'can read' does not have full control to remove a write access. 
2.On 'Can contribute', I see we can add filter options like 'OR users does not contain xx'. 
 So this at least a way to let a user/users are NOT able to write. 
So my conclusion, either 'able to'/'not able to' is controlled in the same tab 'can contribute' for writing access. Just my opinion at the moment.

---

**👤 Carissima** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
Can contribute refers to users that CAN actually contribute to the article, so the answer C because can read CANNOT contribute to the attribute, they can only read

---

**👤 Nexfo** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
Cannot Contribute would be the perfect answer.
For this question, if we add them to Can Read, this will limit their ability to create new articles (I think).
Anyway, it;s the closest thing to correct answer

---

**👤 Kflo** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
A - Can Contrbiture (because Cannot Contribute is not in the choices)

If you define can contribute, it means only the users in the criteria can write, the rest CANNOT.

---

**👤 sri_ravi** ⬆️ 1

Ans is B The "Cannot Author" tab is specifically designed to restrict users from writing or authoring articles in the knowledge base. The "Can Read" tab, on the other hand, only allows users to read the articles without making any changes.

---

**👤 ADILKS** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** C
Can Read: Users can read knowledge articles in the knowledge base.
Cannot Read: Users can't read knowledge articles in the knowledge base.
Can Contribute: Users can create, modify, and retire knowledge articles in a knowledge base. Contribute access to a knowledge base also provides read access to all articles in the knowledge base.
Cannot Contribute: Users can't create, modify, retire, or read knowledge articles in the knowledge base.

**👤 EricSon** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
From ChatGPT - The "cmdb_ci" table, also known as the Configuration Item (CI) table, is the base table in the CMDB hierarchy. It represents the top-level table that contains common fields and attributes for all Configuration Items. It serves as the foundation for all CI classes in the CMDB, such as servers, databases, applications, network devices, and more. Each CI class in the CMDB hierarchy has its own corresponding table that extends the "cmdb_ci" table.

**Selected Answer:** D
The answer is D per the following ServiceNow Doc link. Technically, C and D are both correct but ServiceNow uses the word "record". In the world of databases of course a field is a piece of data in a cell. Yet, I will remind you that ServiceNow likes the word record. I will also say that the term in all the ServiceNow training uses the phrase 'everything in ServiceNow is a record in a table'.

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 1

This Question is really confusing. I wonder if it's from an outdated version ServiceNow or I just don't understand it, but in the Vancouver CSA fundamentals book it's clearly stated that "If there's no user criteria specified in the "Can Read" related list then the Knowledge Base becomes open to the public." Same is the information in the ServiceNow forums: "To make a Knowledge base public navigate to Knowledge > Administration > Knowledge Bases. Select the knowledge base you want to make public. Go to the Can Read section or tab and remove any entries from the list. That way everyone gets read permission on all articles in that knowledge base." 
I could not find any information anywhere about a specific "Public setting". 
Nevertheless, I would probably have to go for answer A as the other ones are even more meaningless.

Option Analysis Valid?
A. Problem == Parent Problem typically is a parent table, not a child. There's no standard reference in Problem pointing to another table via Parent. ❌ Unlikely to appear
B. HR Case → Parent ✅ sn_hr_core_case (HR Case) has a Parent reference field. This is used when nesting HR cases or associating them with a parent item. ✅ Correct
C. Catalog Task → Parent ✅ sc_task has a Parent reference field, pointing to sc_req_item. This is how tasks are tied to requested items. ✅ Correct
D. Outage → Task number Task number is not a reference field, it's a display field (number). The actual reference is likely Task or Affected CI. ❌ Incorrect
E. Release Phase == Parent ✅ rm_release_phase (Release Phase) has a Parent field that links back to rm_release. This is used in project/release planning. ✅ Correct

These options indicate the relationships between the records. For example:

Problem->Parent: Shows related problems where the current record is the parent.
Catalog Task->Parent: Displays catalog tasks related to the parent record.
Outage->Task number: Lists outages associated with a specific task number.

---

**👤 047a2d5** ⬆️ 2

I see in the related list : Problem->Parent but the operator == is not their anymore, I see also outage-> Task number and Catalog Task-> Parent so for me CD I see them but HR Case not their anymore and for Release Phase-> Parent is their but the operator == no. so for me I am sure with CD

Correct answer B: key word here is "easy" which would be to use a module rather than creating business rules.

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** B
Even not knowing for sure if there's a "System Upgraded" notification out of the box, I would go with B - First of all notifications are available in System Notification -> E-mail -> Notifications (so that rules out A), second of all why would the administrator want to send a notification for a completed upgrade (through a Client Script or a Business Rule) to himself? That rules out C and D. So B is the only plausible one.
But to confirm my logic I also went in and checked in my out of the box personal development instance and there is indeed a "System Upgraded" notification in System Notification -> E-mail -> Notifications

---

**👤 Manny1218** ⬆️ 3

D. Server.

When you set a policy that applies to all data entered into the platform, such as through the UI (User Interface), Import Sets, or Web Services, the policy is typically enforced on the server side. The server is responsible for processing and validating the data that is being entered into the platform. By running the policy on the server, the platform can ensure consistent enforcement of the policy rules regardless of the entry point (UI, Import Sets, or Web Services) used to submit the data. This helps maintain data integrity and security across the platform.

Q277 is a duplicate of Q190 but they have different answers. Q190 answer is Banner and Q277 answer is User Menu. Neither gives these options in the other question. Both answers are right, however. Open the User menu by clicking your user avatar in the ServiceNow banner. Select the Impersonate user menu item. In the Select a user to impersonate dialog, enter the name of the user to impersonate in the Search for a user field. Select the user from the list and click the Impersonate user button.

**👤 ssadique** ⬆️ 6

**Selected Answer:** B
The correct answer is B. Incident table is extended from Task table.

Explanation:
In ServiceNow, the Incident table is a child table that extends the Task table. This means that the Incident table inherits fields and functionality from the Task table, which is the parent table for many other tables like Change, Problem, and Request.

A. Incident table has a one to many relationship with the Task table: This is incorrect because Incident is a type of Task, not a separate table with a one-to-many relationship.
B. Incident table is extended from Task table: This is correct. The Incident table inherits from the Task table, meaning incidents are a type of task.

C- Predictive Intelligence is barely mentioned.

---

**👤 Certs_Hub** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** A
In ServiceNow, Assignment Rules are used to automatically allocate tasks, incidents, or service requests to the appropriate assignment group or team member based on specified criteria. These rules help streamline the assignment process and ensure that critical or high-priority items are directed to the appropriate individuals or groups for prompt resolution.

---

**👤 5852843** ⬆️ 3

A is the correct answer. The Assignment rules module allows you to automatically set a value in the assigned_to and assignment_group fields when a set of conditions occurs.

An assignment rule must also meet these additional criteria to run:
The task record has been created or updated. Assignment rules do not apply to unsaved changes on a form.
The task record must be unassigned. The record cannot have an existing value for either the assigned_to or assignment_group fields. Assignment rules cannot overwrite existing assignments (including assignments set by a default value or a previously run assignment rule).
The assignment rule is the first rule that matches the table and conditions. If more than one assignment rule matches the conditions, only the rule with the lowest order value runs.

---

**👤 EricSon** ⬆️ 1

Since the criteria have been predefined as mentioned in the question, so it should be "Assignment Rule".

**👤 NikaDMars** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
C. All > System Properties > UI Properties > Turn on the “Save” button.
To make the Save button appear on the form header, you need to enable the visibility of the button via a system property in UI Properties. This controls whether the Save button is shown on forms globally.


Regarding the rest of options:
* Adding the button in Form Layout (option D) manages which buttons can appear but does not guarantee visibility if the system property disables the button globally.
* The glide.ui.advanced property (option B) enables other advanced UI features but not specifically the Save button.
* Form Design (option A) is used for field layout, not header buttons.

---

**👤 adyrip** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
I initially picked B. 

C is the most correct answer, although B is also true. At least in the Washington PDI, you get the option to "Show Save, Insert, Insert and Stay" Buttons. It is also the glide property, but in the tool options you see it as Save Button.

---

**👤 Kflo** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** C
C - try all the options..

---

**👤 SnowNick** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** B
There is no "Turn on the save button" option.

The option is called "Show "Save", "Insert" and "Insert and Stay" buttons on form", and if you check the property name, it is called "glide.ui.advanced”. 

So answer is option B.

---

**👤 aper** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** B
Answer is B.
In All > System Properties > UI Properties, check the box "Show "Save", "Insert" and "Insert " and Stay" buttons on forms, which turns on the "glide.ui.advanced" property.

---

**👤 DDD1377** ⬆️ 2

C is the correct answer. You cannot add the SAVE button in the form header using Form Layout or Form Design.

---

**👤 Mehamood** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** C
You can only do it by checking on Show "Save", "Insert" and "Insert and Stay" buttons on forms option. You can try it in your PDI

---

**👤 Macramento** ⬆️ 1

C... just tested it in the PDI, vancouver release.

---

**👤 ElifSurucu** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
Form Layout: This is the area where you can configure the arrangement and placement of fields, buttons, and other elements on a form.
Therefore, option D is the correct action to take to ensure that the "Save" button appears in the Form header when editing a new incident record in ServiceNow.

This is a bit tricky because the entire time I'm thinking from an admin perspective and my colleague would also be an admin so Option A would be a logical choice for more control and dot walking capabilities if they need it. D is also correct. I guess the term "colleague" is where this can be tricky. I hope the test marks D as the correct answer.

Correct answer is D - This is the "Gear" icon on the right-hand side of the list header, and it's called Personalize List (hover over the gear icon and you'll see the name).
Answers A is incorrect as through this option you don't change your personal view of the list but the the list view for everyone, and only admins and specialized admins can do that.

there is no correct answer here.
Should be Service Catalog -> open records -> requests

---

**👤 6d50eb7** ⬆️ 6

**Selected Answer:** C
The question is how would you view the lists of REQUESTS, not items. Therefore the answer is C.

---

**👤 IT_Bank** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** D
Answer is D 100%. Tested in my PDI. All --> Service Catalog --> Open Records --> Items has a field called "Requests" which, you guessed it, has REQ values.
Its not C because All --> Service Catalog --> Requests does not exist.

---

**👤 2ace220** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
List of Request (REQ) is different from the list of requested item (RITM)
REQ = ALL> SERVICE CATALOG > REQUEST
RITM = ALL > SERVICE CATALOG > OPEN RECORD > ITEM

---

**👤 adyrip** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
The question mentions Requests and I initially picked C. But that path doesn't exist in the Navigator, D is the only viable path and you can see a list of Items, in the list view you can also see Requests.

Very poorly phrased question.

---

**👤 Kflo** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
D - this is how you get to open RITMs

it's not C - who looks at REQ unless its an order guide or bundle requests with multiple RITMs

---

**👤 Schoolboz** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
it is C. The question asked for a list of requests, not of items.

---

**👤 PappyFox** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** C
Service Catalog > Requests is the standard navigation path to view a list of requests placed through the Service Catalog. It displays all Request [sc_request] records, including details like request numbers, requesters, and statuses.

---

**👤 aper** ⬆️ 1

All->Service Catalog->Open Records ->Requests. So the answer is E. None of the above.

---

**👤 96d187b** ⬆️ 2

The correct answer is C. All > Service Catalog > Requests.

When an order is placed through the Service Catalog, it generates a request record in the Request [sc_request] table. This record can be viewed under the Service Catalog application in the navigator. 

For those saying D — This navigates to catalog items, not the requests.

---

**👤 SNOW_SAGAR** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** B
The correct answer is:

B. A metric is a time measurement used to report the effectiveness of workflows and SLAs

Explanation:
In ServiceNow, a metric:

Tracks and records the amount of time an item (like an incident, change, or task) spends in a particular state or with a certain value.

Is commonly used to measure SLA (Service Level Agreement) compliance and workflow efficiency.

Helps in analyzing how long it takes for a record to progress through various stages, e.g., how long an incident remains in "New" state.

Why the other options are incorrect:
A. Incorrect – That's describing a gauge, not a metric.

C. Close but vague – Doesn't emphasize the time-based nature of a metric.

D. Incorrect – The term "comparative measurement" is misleading; metrics focus on time-based tracking.

**👤 dnbly** ⬆️ 4

**Selected Answer:** ACE
C - NEW employee will need an account setting up otherwise they can't access anything ever. If your work Instance use LDAP or Azure Sync or some other method then good for you but these are not configured OOB and the question doesn't reference them. Either way, the very first step is account setup regardless of means.
AE - best practice is to assign Role(s) to the Group (especially for dependencies) so ITIL should have been added to these already therefore adding the new user to either Group will allow them to inherit ITIL Role.

Creating a Group specifically to assign the ITIL Role would not be best practice as it could be removed independently of other access that requires it to be in place. This means that adding to an ITIL Group would be incorrect (as would adding the Role directly).

---

**👤 RoupT** ⬆️ 2

ADE is the answer. 
 I never create user accounts in SN. They are always sent vis feed through LDAP. 
The question is about access, and with an ITIL role, this user can't see anything. The question is poorly worded.

**Selected Answer:** D
incident.None includes all fields and column (entire table) then comes the part where any specific field are not to be included which is done by include.field here comes to play the incident.* (wildcard) that includes all the fields except one defined by include.field.
thus correct option will be incident.None

---

**👤 MACCA81** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** D
incident.* rule applies to all fields on the table that are NOT controlled by a specific field rule. i.e. if there are no field rules on any of the field it can represent the whole table, but as long as there's even one specific field rule it will represent all the other fields in the table but NOT this one. Hence A cannot be the correct answer.
incident.None rule represents access to the table as a whole. It's the correct answer.

additional reference in ServiceNow Administrator Fundamentals eBook Page 60
The None access Control (which appears as just sys_user) granted all rows and all fields to both the table_admin and table_user roles.

---

**👤 szycha002** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
Best Practice:
- when creating .* Access Controls, also create a None Access Control, because only None grants access to records
- when writing an ACL that mostly grants access, use only None
- when writing an ACL that mostly denies access, use None and .*

---

**👤 gedgy** ⬆️ 2

Completely agree with kanafuka225. The table.* is allowing access to both of these new roles to all rows and fields as specified. Conversely, table.none is restricting all row and field access to these two roles.

---

**👤 SuiR** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
none will be used to grant all accesses to the record

---

**👤 Prepper003** ⬆️ 3

**Selected Answer:** A
.none is the table level which grants access to all fields and rows.

---

**👤 kanafuka225** ⬆️ 4

**Selected Answer:** D
The customer .* ACL rule would grant access to all rows and all fields to both the customer_table_admin and customer_table_user roles because it uses a wildcard (*) to match any operation on the customer table. The other options are either too restrictive or too broad.

From the actual ServiceNow fundamentals course transcript:

""Some records—for example, surveys and catalog items—allow you to copy records through Insert and Insert and Stay. Check for these options on the form context menu if you want to create a copy of the current record. Insert copies the record and redisplays the list. Insert and Stay copies the record and keeps it open so that you can work on the new copy immediately."

Kristen: Tell me about it! If I want to make a copy of the record and close the form, I make my changes, and then just select Insert. I'm good to go. So simple! "

dictionary overrides can be used to set field properties in extended tables in ServiceNow. An extended table is a custom database table that is created by extending an existing base table in the platform. When you create an extended table, you can specify which fields from the base table you want to include in the new table, as well as any additional fields that are specific to the extended table.

You can use dictionary overrides to modify the properties of fields in an extended table in much the same way as you would for fields in a base table. For example, you might use a dictionary override to change the label or description of a field, or to specify a default value or a custom picker for that field.

It is important to note that dictionary overrides apply to the specific field that they are defined for, and do not affect other fields in the same table or in related tables. So if you want to modify the properties of multiple fields in an extended table, you will need to create separate dictionary overrides for each field.

**👤 Dibonddo** ⬆️ 2

A Dictionary Override is a feature of the ServiceNow platform, which is used for IT service management. It allows customers to update or modify the metadata (dictionary) of a specific table in a ServiceNow instance, even if that table has been customized by the instance owner. This allows for greater flexibility in customization and ensures that customer updates can be easily managed and tracked.

In simple terms, a Dictionary Override occurs when a customer updates the metadata of a table in a ServiceNow instance that has already been customized by the instance owner. The customer update is stored separately from the instance owner's customization, and can be easily identified and managed.

C. Roles are used to control application and module access in most systems that use role-based access control (RBAC) as a security model. Roles are assigned to users or groups and define the permissions and access levels that they have within the system. By defining roles with specific permissions, access to applications and modules can be restricted to only those users who need it, while preventing unauthorized access. Access Control Rules, UI Policies, and Assignment Rules are used for other purposes within the system, such as enforcing data security or automating tasks.

correct answer is D. A Record Producer is a type of Catalog Item that allows users to create task-based records from the Service Catalog.

In the context of IT service management and ServiceNow platform, a Record Producer is a type of Catalog Item that enables users to create new records of a specified table and task-based records from the Service Catalog interface. It is a form-based interface that presents users with fields and options to fill in, which then generates a new record in the designated table with the entered information.

Record Producers are often used to facilitate user self-service and automate the creation of records for various types of requests, such as incidents, change requests, or service requests. They can also be used to bundle multiple requests into a single, easy-to-use interface, making it simpler for users to order multiple services or items at once.

D may be the correct answer for the exam but for people wanting to know the actual use. A record producer can be used to insert a record directly from the service catalog into ANY table, task-based or otherwise.

Correct answer is A. They direct the user to a record producer.

The three services in the Service Catalog - Incident, Password Reset, and Report Outage - have in common that they all direct the user to a record producer. A record producer is a form that allows users to create a new record, such as an incident or a password reset request, in the ServiceNow platform. When a user requests any of these services, they are directed to a record producer where they can fill out the required information and submit the request.

While the specific details of each record producer may vary depending on the service being requested, the commonality between them is that they all serve as the starting point for creating a new record in the ServiceNow platform.

Correct answer is C. Import Set Table is a staging area for imported records in ServiceNow. It is used to import data from various sources into ServiceNow tables. Import Set Tables provide a temporary holding area for records imported from a data source such as a CSV file, an Excel file, or a database table. Once the records are imported into the Import Set Table, they can be transformed and then moved to the appropriate ServiceNow table. The Import Set Table is typically used in conjunction with Transform Maps, which define how the imported data is transformed and mapped to ServiceNow tables

Correct answer is D. An existing Transform Map can be used multiple times on the same import set is a characteristic of importing data into ServiceNow. Transform Maps are used to map data from an import set to fields in a ServiceNow table. Once a Transform Map is created, it can be used multiple times on the same import set or on different import sets that have the same data structure. This makes it easier to import data into ServiceNow, especially if you need to import the same type of data on a regular basis.

Admin can define individual catalog items using Service Catalog > Catalog Definition > Maintain Item application. You can create, edit, and copy catalog items.

Maintain items is an application module that list few types of request items like catalog item, record producer, standard change templates, software catalog, hardware catalog etc. All of these are extended from the base sc_cat_item table and used for request fulfillment from your service catalog. They do create new records ie request or RITM from catalog items or a task based record from a record producer or a change from standard template.

**Selected Answer:** B
The correct answer is: B. Maintain Items
Why not the others:
A. Maintain Categories: Used to manage and organize catalog categories, not individual items.

The answer to this question may vary depending on the specific Service Catalog software being used. However, based on common practices, the three variable types that can be added to a Service Catalog Item are typically:

D. Multiple Choice, Select Box, and Checkbox

These variable types allow users to select options from a predefined list and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as selecting a specific model or version of a product, choosing a department or location, or selecting a priority level. Other variable types that may also be supported by some Service Catalog software include text fields, date/time pickers, and attachments.

A. Workflows are moved using Update Sets.

Update Sets are used to move customizations and configurations from one ServiceNow instance to another. Workflows, being a type of customization, can be moved between instances using Update Sets. When you create an Update Set, you can add workflows to it, along with any related components such as tables, fields, business rules, and UI pages. Once you have created an Update Set, you can then export it from the source instance and import it into the target instance. This allows you to move workflows and other customizations between instances as needed.

---

**👤 PLiza2** ⬆️ 1

A is correct

---

**👤 PLiza2** ⬆️ 3

The system tracks workflows in update sets differently than other records because workflow information is stored across multiple tables.

Changes made to a workflow version are not added to the update set until the workflow is published, at which point the entire workflow is added into the update set. Update sets store workflows as a single Workflow [wf_workflow] record and only retain the latest version with the update type of Workflow.

---

**👤 Thattechgirl** ⬆️ 6

The correct answer is: D. Make active, set visibility, and save

To make a list filter available to everyone in ServiceNow, you need to make it active, set the visibility to "Public," and save the changes. Here are the steps to follow:

Navigate to the list that you want to create the filter for, and click the "Filter" button to open the filter editor.

In the filter editor, select the fields and conditions that you want to use to define the filter, and then click the "Save" button.

In the "Save As" dialog, enter a name for the filter, and then select the "Public" option in the "Visibility" field.

Click the "Save" button to save the filter.

Once you have saved the filter, it will be available to all users who have access to the list, regardless of their role or group membership. You can also use the "Shared" option in the "Visibility" field to make the filter available to specific groups or users, rather than to everyone.

---

**👤 alsman** ⬆️ 3

'Task' is the parent table of all task-type records in the system. It is the parent of REQ, RITM, and SCTASK.

When you order a catalog item, the system generates a single RITM record for each item in the cart at the time you order. These RITM records are all grouped underneath a parent REQ record.

Depending on your workflow, you might also have SCTASK records that get generated as children of a RITM record

A is the correct answer. The CI Relationship Editor is used to create Configuration Item relationship and define which is the base CI class, which is the dependant one and what is the dependency. 
The CI Class Manager is a central location for the CI class hierarchy in the CMDB 0 it displays the entire CI Class hierarchy in a tree-view format and consolidates CI class definitions in a central location

(ChatGPT) The CI Relationship Editor is the tool you would use to create dependencies between Configuration Items (CIs) in the CMDB.

This tool allows you to:
 • Define and establish relationships, including dependency relationships, between individual CIs.
 • Create, modify, and visualize how CIs depend on each other (e.g., a server depending on a database, or an application depending on a server).

By using the CI Relationship Editor, you can ensure that the relationships between different CIs reflect the actual dependencies within your IT infrastructure.

c - Data policies enable you to enforce data consistency by setting mandatory and read-only states for fields.

Data policies are similar to UI policies, but UI policies only apply to data entered on a form through the standard browser. Data policies can apply rules to all data entered into the system, including data brought in through import sets or web services and data entered through the mobile UI.

With remote instances, the update sets are already previewed during the retrieval. The platform does it for you! Click the Retrieve Completed Update Sets button or related link. Any update sets marked as Complete are transferred from the source (sub-production) instance to the target (production) instance.

**👤 melmel** ⬆️ 2

The correct answer is D. an integration step.

Integration steps are the building blocks of IntegrationHub flows. They allow you to execute third-party APIs, call other flows, or perform other actions as part of a flow.

Here are some examples of integration steps:

API Call: Executes a third-party API.
Flow Call: Calls another flow.
Script: Runs a custom script.
Integration steps are referred to as "spokes" in the IntegrationHub documentation. However, the more widely used term is "integration step."

The other options are incorrect:

Option A: Actions are tasks that can be performed in a flow, such as sending an email or creating a record. They are not used to execute third-party APIs.
Option B: Spokes are a type of integration step that allows you to call other flows. However, they are not the only type of integration step.
Option C: Connections are used to connect to third-party APIs. However, they are not used to execute the APIs.

C is the right anwser

---

**👤 cluelessdood** ⬆️ 1

I think SN switched from "general-to-specific" to "specific-to-general" somewhere between San Diego and Tokyo.

In San Diego:
This processing order ensures that users gain access to more general objects before gaining access to more specific objects. A user must pass both table and field ACL rules to access a record object.

In Tokyo:
This processing order ensures that users gain access to more specific objects before gaining access to more general objects. A user must pass both table and field ACL rules to access a record object.

In my "Additional ServiceNow Fundamentals Content for System Administrators and Developers course" (San Diego edition), it says:
When a session requests data, the system looks for matching access control rules.
Record ACL rules are processed in the following order:
1. Match the object against table ACL rules - most specific to most general.
2. Match the object against field ACL rules - most specific to most general.

**👤 Dekoreh** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** C
C is the correct answer

---

**👤 Shimdog** ⬆️ 1

The correct statement is A. Table access rules are evaluated from the general to the specific.

In ServiceNow, the evaluation of Access Control rules follows a general-to-specific order. This means that the more general rules are evaluated first, followed by more specific rules. The system checks the access control rules for a table, starting with the global (most general) rules, and then proceeds to evaluate table-specific and field-specific rules.

Answer is A

In ServiceNow, if both a row-level rule and a field-level rule exist, both rules do not need to be true for an operation to be allowed. The rules are evaluated independently, and if either the row-level rule or the field-level rule allows the operation, it will be permitted.

The "My Groups Work" list in ServiceNow only displays tasks that:
1. Belong to the user's assignment groups (Network and Hardware in this case).
2. Are not yet assigned to a specific user (i.e., Assigned to field is empty).
If tasks are already assigned to specific individuals within the groups, the manager will not see them in My Groups Work.

---

**👤 Nexfo** ⬆️ 2

**Selected Answer:** A
Looking at the conditions correct answer cannot be \My Groups Work:

Assignment group = groups you're a member of
Active = true
Assigned to = EMPTY
State is not Pending

The breadcrums show that these groups were added to the filter, therefore he MUST be member of these groups.

I select A

---

**👤 adyrip** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
I choose A. 

This is the correct statement, if there are no unassigned tasks, you cannot see anything via My Groups Work. 

B - false – the manager has ITIL role if he can run the above filter from the view and he can access the SD module from the Navigator

C – false – The Service Desk group vs the Service Desk module are 2 different things and the SD group is not mentioned in the question

D – false - If he has the ITIL role, he doesn’t have to be a member of the groups, assuming there are no rules in place to restrict the view only to those members. There is no mention of such a rule so we cannot assume it exists. 

E – potentially true – this is a very particular case, he is not a member of those groups, he is not a manager of those groups so there is nothing there. But I think the most correct and complete answer is A. 

Very confusing phrasing for this question, all in all.

---

**👤 Kflo** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** A
A - I think the hint is that members are working on many tasks. Therefore, most likely no more unassigned tasks.

**👤 SnowNick** ⬆️ 1

**👤 aper** ⬆️ 1

**Selected Answer:** D
Answer is D. 
In my opinion, ff the question indicated that the manager is aware of unassigned tasks but is unable to view them, then option A would be the correct choice.

---

**👤 96d187b** ⬆️ 1

I would say A — the reason he's not seeing the tasks that they're working on is because the My Groups Work only shows tasks that are unassigned. If the team members are actively working on the tasks, then the manager won't see anything in this section. I'm assuming the first sentence makes it clear he belongs to the appropriate groups, but it's definitely a tricky one where multiple responses could work.

ABEI It seems A vs. F is the only contention here.
Homepages and content pages are not added to Update Sets by default. You must manually add pages to the current Update Set by unloading them. https://www.servicenow.com/community/itsm-forum/adding-homepage-customizations-to-update-set/m-p/812803

---

**👤 gprieto** ⬆️ 1

The correct is ABEI

---

**👤 96d187b** ⬆️ 2

A: Homepages are the same as Portal Pages or Dashboards, which are not included by default. They can be, but they require the Unload Dashboard function. 
Data: not captured 
Schedules: not captured 
Schedule Jobs: not captured 

Refer to the visual in Workbook section 7.2: What is Captured in a Data Set? Notice that in the X column, Dashboards appears with an asterisk* — I think they are using Homepage to represent Dashboard in this question.
B: Data is not captured like an Incident record
E: Schedules
I: Scheduled Jobs

F is incorrect: Database updates like a new table or a new field in a table would be included

---

**👤 ae6ab69** ⬆️ 5

**Selected Answer:** ABEI
A: Homepages ~ Portal Pages ~ Dashboards. Dashboards need to be added via Unlaod Dashboard function.
B: Data is not captured like an Incident record
